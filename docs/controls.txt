gtk.Button

* The image should work the same of the image button
* Need to write a theme to match the visual style

* Write a list of stock icons people should use and replace them in the theme to match our visual style

sugar.Icon

* Used in canvas-like views so probably an Hippo item.
* Svg Only.
* It should support xo colors easily.
* Rollovers with a focus mark.

sugar.IconButton

* Support for SVG and png.
* Icons should be grey scale. But might be coloured with the XO colors (svg only)
* Size of the button is 75 pixels, size of the icon canvas is 55 and suggested icon size is around 45.

    Inactive. Fallbacks if no inactive icon is specified.
        Svg: Remove the fill and render the stroke in button grey
        Png: just do some effect on the pixbuf, which also work for grey icons
