Dependencies
============

xulrunner
gecko-embed

http://gnome.org/~marco/olpc

Building
========

You will need gnome-common.

./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
make
make install # make require root privileges

Running
=======

Once installed you can run sugar with

 $ sugar

To run the python sources from your source tree run

 $ sugar/sugar

You can also run the components separately:

 $ source ./setup-run-from-source.sh # needs bash

in the top-level directory. Icons and other resources are still loaded
from the installed location though.

To run the shell

 $ cd shell/src
 $ ./shell.py

You can run activities like this

 $ cd browser
 $ ./browser.py

(Just remember to have the shell running)


Running two instances on the same machine
=========================================

1) Install Xephyr
2) Add another user to your machine, lets call that user 'sugar'
2) Run Xepyhr as your normal user:

 $ Xephyr -ac -host-cursor -screen 800x600 :1

3) In a new shell:

 $ su sugar -
 $ dbus-daemon --session --print-address

4) In another new shell 

 $ su sugar -
 $ export DISPLAY=:1
 $ export DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS=<output dbus-daemon command from above>
 $ metacity &

5) In the previous shell, run sugar
