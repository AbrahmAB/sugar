Building
========

You will need gnome-common.

./autogen.sh --prefix=/usr --sysconfdir=/etc --localstatedir=/var
make
make install # make require root privileges

Running
=======

To run the python sources from your source tree run

 $ source ./setup-run-from-source.sh # needs bash

in the top-level directory. Icons and other resources are still loaded
from the installed location though.

To run the shell

 $ cd shell/src
 $ ./shell.py

You can run activities like this

 $ cd browser
 $ ./browser.py

(Just remember to have the shell running)
